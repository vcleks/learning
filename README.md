# Learning
This serves as a place for me to learn the basics and more advanced things that `css`, `html` and `javascript` have to offer while I attempt to create a landing page that suits my needs.

## Description
This repository features a future landing page with a flex grid that has 3 responsive columns, which, when the users browser is under 767px in width, will collapse into a "pancake" layer style. It served as a gateway to learn how to center things (which we all know is a pain in css, lol) and playing with the z-index as a way of layering the content. Whenever you hover over a section, you will notice there's an outer glow. To achieve this, it was quite a brain teaser to figure out how to achieve the wanted result but I managed to. 


## Is there a live version?
At the given moment, I upload the results on [my website](https://leks.dev/learning/).
Please bear in mind this is not the updated version as I will only be updating it ever so often.


## What do I use?
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) alongside [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
To upload the files to my web server, I use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

## Can I use your code?
Yes, you can use, change, copy, edit or do whatever you want with anything in this repository.
