# Learning


## Description
This serves as a place for me to learn the basics and more advanced things that `css`, `html` and `javascript` have to offer while I attempt to create a landing page that suits my needs.

## Where can I find the result?
At the given moment, the results will be available on [my website](https://leks.dev/learning/).


## What do I use?
I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) alongside [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
To upload the files to my web server, I use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

## Can I use your code?
Yes, you can use, change, copy, edit or do whatever you want with anything in this repository.
